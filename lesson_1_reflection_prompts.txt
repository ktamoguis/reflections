How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff pointed out the differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    tracking differences in the history would make programming more efficient

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    commit lets you have the choice of when to save so that you control the content of wht's saved.
    automatic saving may have you seeing two versions which are the same.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    to manage different versions more easily. automatic saving of files may make others
    the number of files too many to manage.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to view different versions and git diff to see the difference between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    by being able to revert to a previous version of the file, the programmer is ensured that working versions
    of a file before a bug, is still saved.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try it on some actual code.
